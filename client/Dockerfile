# Dance Trainer is a Vite app, not a folder of static files: the source
# index.html points at /src/main.tsx, which a browser will not execute. It has
# to be built first and the *built* output served — copying the repo in
# directly serves the dev entry point and renders a blank page.

# ---- Build ----

# scripts/ has to land before `npm ci`: postinstall runs setup-assets.mjs,
# which copies the MediaPipe WASM runtime out of node_modules and downloads the
# pose models into public/.

# Accounts are opt-in and baked in at build time. Left empty the app runs
# entirely locally with no network calls. This deployment's values live in
# fly.toml under [build.args] so that a plain `fly deploy` cannot quietly ship
# a build with sign-in missing; override per-build with:
#   fly deploy --build-arg VITE_PLAYKIT_URL=https://your-playkit-host

# Google sign-in. The client ID is public (it ships in the bundle), but it must
# be declared here — Docker silently ignores a --build-arg with no matching ARG,
# and Vite then inlines an empty string and drops the whole button as dead code.
